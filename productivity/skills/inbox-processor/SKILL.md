name: inbox-processor
description: >
  Checks a dedicated Todoist project ("Claude's Inbox") and Google Drive Inbox
  (gdrive:Claude/Inbox) for unprocessed notes and screenshots captured from the user's phone.
  Actively resolves items — answering questions, making small changes, applying feedback,
  creating tasks, deleting noise — rather than just classifying and presenting. Uses Todoist
  MCP tools and rclone for Drive. Meta-feedback is applied first, then all items are
  presented in a resolution table for approval before execution. Rants are queued for
  end-of-session journaling. Use this skill when the session-start hook detects inbox items,
  or when the user says "check my inbox", "process my notes", or "what's in my inbox".

# Inbox Processor

## Purpose

This skill processes notes from Claude's Inbox in Todoist and actively resolves them. Not just routing — answering questions, making changes, creating tasks, applying feedback, deleting noise. Items are classified, a resolution plan is built, and then executed after the user's approval.

## Dependencies

- **Todoist MCP tools:** `find-projects`, `find-tasks`, `find-comments`, `add-tasks`, `complete-tasks`, `add-comments`, `delete-object`, `add-sections`, `find-sections`
- **`gws` CLI** for Google Calendar operations (design decision: NOT Google Calendar MCP — `gws` is proven and provides more control over calendar selection and event formatting)
- **`rclone`** with `gdrive:` remote for encyclopedia files and Google Drive Inbox (`gdrive:Claude/Inbox`)
- **Note:** `$TODOIST_TOKEN` is still needed for the `check-inbox.sh` SessionStart hook but is NOT used by this skill

## Classification Categories

| Category | What it covers | Resolution | Autonomy |
|---|---|---|---|
| Meta-feedback | Changes to how Claude behaves, skill/spec improvements, process corrections | Apply to skill/memory/spec files | Approval required |
| Small feature requests | Quick changes to existing skills/hooks/configs | Implement directly, update specs | Autonomous (spec changes shown) |
| Research questions | Questions for Claude to answer | Research and present answer inline | Autonomous |
| Document updates | Planned updates to specs, CLAUDE.md, non-encyclopedia system files | Apply changes | Autonomous |
| Todoist tasks | Actionable tasks that fit an existing project | Create in the matching project | Autonomous |
| Calendar events | Events, appointments, concerts with date/time | Create via `gws` | Autonomous if unambiguous |
| Encyclopedia facts | People info, preferences, biographical facts, ANY change to the 8 modular source files | Route to encyclopedia-update skill | Approval required (existing mandate) |
| Rants/reflections | Spoken word, journal-worthy thoughts, interview requests | Queue for end-of-session journal/interview | Presented, processed last |
| Spec-routable | Ideas/improvements/bugs that reference an existing skill or feature with a spec | Add to "Planned Updates" or "Known Bugs / Issues" in that feature's spec | Autonomous (spec changes shown) |
| Unresolvable | Big project ideas, unclear items, things needing a dedicated session | Present to the user for triage before building resolution table | User decides per-item |
| Noise | Accidental entries, typos, meaningless text | Delete | Shown in plan, deleted on approval |

### Classification Boundary Rules

- **Meta-feedback vs. small features:** Meta-feedback = corrections or behavioral changes that affect the *current inbox processing run* (e.g., "read newest first", "stop summarizing"). Small features = skill/hook/config changes that improve functionality but don't alter the current run's behavior (e.g., "add source file paths to librarian output").
- **Document updates vs. encyclopedia facts:** Any note targeting the 8 encyclopedia modular files (Core Identity, Status Snapshot, People Database, Chronicle, Beliefs and Positions, Predictions, Open Threads and Goals, Preferences and Reference Data) is ALWAYS classified as "Encyclopedia facts," regardless of phrasing. "Document updates" covers specs, CLAUDE.md, and non-encyclopedia system files only.
- **Due dates as signals:** If a Todoist task has a due date set, use it as a classification signal — it likely indicates a calendar event or time-sensitive Todoist task rather than a reflection or idea.
- **Spec-routable vs. unresolvable:** If an item references an existing skill or feature that has a spec (e.g., "refactor gmessages", "improve voice skill", "gmessages crashes when..."), classify it as "Spec-routable" — it gets added to that feature's spec under either "Planned Updates" (for improvements/ideas) or "Known Bugs / Issues" (for bug reports/problems). Only classify as "Unresolvable" if there's no clear spec target (standalone project ideas, unclear items, things that don't map to any existing feature).

---

## Phase 1 — Ingest

1. **Find Claude's Inbox project.** Use `find-projects` with search="Claude's Inbox". If not found, create it via `add-projects`.

2. **Find or create Claude Tasks section.** Use `find-sections` with projectId=<inbox project ID>. Look for a section named "Claude Tasks". If missing, create it via `add-sections` with name="Claude Tasks" and projectId=<inbox project ID>.

3. **Fetch all incomplete tasks.** Use `find-tasks` with projectId=<inbox project ID> and limit=100.

4. **Separate Claude Tasks items.** Identify tasks whose sectionId matches the Claude Tasks section. Exclude these from processing. Count them for the "Parked Items" summary shown later.

5. **Re-presentation guard.** For each remaining task, fetch comments via `find-comments` with taskId=<task ID>. Check for:
   - `[presented: YYYY-MM-DD]` where the date is today — skip this task (already shown today, the user didn't act on it)
   - `[queued-for-journal: YYYY-MM-DD]` — skip this task (already queued for journaling)

6. **Ignore Todoist attachments.** Todoist file URLs require web session cookies and cannot be downloaded via the API or Bearer token. If a task comment has an `attachment` field, note it in the summary as "has Todoist attachment (not accessible)" — the actual file content should be in the Drive Inbox instead.

7. **Check Google Drive Inbox.** List files in `gdrive:Claude/Inbox` via `rclone lsf "gdrive:Claude/Inbox"`. For each file found:
   - Download to `/tmp/` via `rclone copy "gdrive:Claude/Inbox/<filename>" /tmp/`
   - If image (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.webp`) — read with Claude's vision to extract text/facts/dates
   - If PDF (`.pdf`) — read with Claude's native PDF capability
   - All other types — note the file exists, attempt to read as text
   - After successful processing, delete the file from Drive: `rclone deletefile "gdrive:Claude/Inbox/<filename>"`
   - Drive Inbox files are treated as additional inbox entries alongside Todoist tasks. They are classified and resolved using the same category system.
   - If a Drive file clearly corresponds to a Todoist task (e.g., a screenshot referenced by a task title), associate them as a single entry.

8. **Check for empty inbox.** If no processable tasks and no Drive Inbox files remain after filtering, report "Inbox is clear" (plus parked items count if any) and exit.

8. **Read all entries before any action.** Process newest to oldest (deliberate: newer notes are more likely to supersede or correct older ones). Consider cross-entry context — later notes may override earlier ones, and multiple notes may describe a single event or fact.

---

## Phase 2 — Classify & Extract Meta-Feedback

Classify every entry into the 10 categories above. Apply the classification boundary rules.

Extract all meta-feedback items regardless of their position in the list. These are processed first in Phase 3 so that subsequent phases operate under updated behavior.

---

## Phase 3 — Apply Meta-Feedback

If meta-feedback items exist:

1. Present proposed changes: which files, specs, or memories would change and how.
2. Wait for the user's approval.
3. Apply the approved changes.
4. Remaining items are now processed under the updated behavior.

If no meta-feedback items exist, skip this phase silently.

---

## Phase 4 — Build Resolution Plan

For remaining items, build a resolution plan in this priority order:

1. **Small feature requests** — Identify the change, which files it touches, and prepare the implementation. Read relevant specs before proposing changes.

2. **Research questions** — Actually do the research. Prepare a concise answer to present inline in the resolution table.

3. **Document updates** — Identify the target spec/file and the proposed change.

4. **Todoist tasks** — Identify the target project via `find-projects`. Prepare `add-tasks` parameters (content, projectId, due_string if applicable). Only create tasks that fit an existing project.

5. **Calendar events** — Identify the correct calendar using the mapping table below. Prepare the `gws` command with summary, start/end times.

6. **Encyclopedia facts** — Prepare the proposed update for the `encyclopedia-update` skill. The approval gate per CLAUDE.md applies.

7. **Spec-routable** — For items that reference an existing skill or feature with a spec, read the target spec and prepare an entry under either "Planned Updates" (for improvements/ideas) or "Known Bugs / Issues" (for bug reports/problems). The entry should capture the intent of the note in a way that's actionable in a future session.

8. **Noise** — Flag for deletion.

9. **Rants/reflections** — Flag for end-of-session journaling. These are ALWAYS last and executed after all other items.

10. **Unresolvable** — Do NOT include in the resolution table yet. These are handled in Phase 4.5.

### Calendar Mapping

| Event type | Target calendar |
|---|---|
| Work events | Work Events |
| Social / concerts / friends | Social Events |
| Appointments (dentist, doctor, etc.) | Appointments |
| Partner's stuff | Partner's Schedule |
| School | School Events |
| Family | Family |
| Default (when unclear) | Appointments |

---

## Phase 4.5 — Triage Unresolvable Items

If any items were classified as "Unresolvable" in Phase 2, present them to the user **before** building the resolution table. For each item, briefly state what it is and why it can't be resolved in this run, then ask where it should go:

- **Claude Tasks** — park it for a future dedicated session
- **Open Thread** — add to Open Threads & Goals (approval gate applies)
- **Delete** — discard it
- **Leave** — keep in inbox for next run

Example:

> **I couldn't resolve these on my own — where should they go?**
>
> 1. "package Claude system for a friend" — Big project: deidentification, security review, install docs. **Claude Tasks / Open Thread / Delete / Leave?**
> 2. "full system audit" — Multi-session effort across specs and CLAUDE.md. **Claude Tasks / Open Thread / Delete / Leave?**

Wait for the user's direction on each item before proceeding to Phase 5. Items routed to Claude Tasks or Open Thread are then included in the resolution table with their assigned action.

---

## Phase 5 — Present Resolution Summary

Present results **grouped by category**, not as one flat table. Each group has a header and only appears if it has items. Order:

### Completed
Items that were already done or can be immediately closed. Listed as bullet points.
> - "implement inbox processor" — already live, completing
> - "inbox processor implementation gap" — gaps already patched, completing

### Meta-Feedback Applied
Show what was changed and where (already done in Phase 3). Listed as bullet points.
> - "read newest first" — already in skill, no change needed
> - "improve thoroughness" — already matches current skill design

### Research Answers
For each question, give the answer directly. Listed as Q&A pairs.
> **"check if i have code security agent"**
> No — no security agent or skill installed. Could build one or find an existing tool on GitHub.
>
> **"can you create Android apps?"**
> Yes — via PWAs, React Native/Expo, or Flutter. Claude can write the code.

### Actions Ready to Execute
Items Claude will act on (tasks, calendar events, document updates, spec-routable items, small features). Shown as a compact table.
> | # | Entry | Action |
> |---|---|---|
> | 1 | "Concert Saturday 8pm" | Create event on Social Events calendar |
> | 2 | "refactor gmessages" | Add as planned update in gmessages spec |

### Noise
Items flagged for deletion. Listed as bullet points.
> - "om" — delete

### Rants (Queued for Journal)
Listed last. Brief summary of each, flagged for end-of-session journaling.
> - AI economics rant — queue for journal (with short interview as requested)

### Unresolvable (Triaged)
Items from Phase 4.5, showing the user's chosen routing.
> - "package for a friend" → Claude Tasks
> - "full system audit" → Open Thread

Rules:
- Skip any group that has zero items
- The user approves, tweaks, or rejects individual items within each group
- After all groups, show: "X items parked in Claude Tasks" if any exist

---

## Phase 6 — Execute

For each approved item, execute in resolution table order (rants last):

**Calendar events:**
```bash
gws calendar events create --params '{"calendarId": "<CALENDAR_ID>"}' \
  --json '{"summary": "<EVENT>", "start": {"dateTime": "<START>"}, "end": {"dateTime": "<END>"}}'
```

**Todoist tasks:** Use `add-tasks` MCP tool with the target projectId, content, and due_string.

**Encyclopedia facts:** Invoke the `encyclopedia-update` skill with the specific facts. The approval gate per CLAUDE.md applies — present proposed changes and wait for the user's approval before writing.

**Small feature requests:** Implement the change. Update specs if needed (per specs system rules).

**Document updates:** Apply the change to the target file.

**Spec-routable items:** Read the target spec, add the item to either "Planned Updates" (for improvements/ideas) or "Known Bugs / Issues" (for bug reports/problems) — create the section if it doesn't exist. Include the original note content and a brief description of what the update would involve. Then `complete-tasks` on the original inbox task.

**Unresolvable items routed to Claude Tasks:** Create a new task in the Claude Tasks section via `add-tasks` with sectionId=<Claude Tasks section ID>. Preserve the original content and description. Then `complete-tasks` on the original inbox task.

**Noise:** Use `delete-object` with type="task" and id=<taskId>.

**Rants/reflections (ALWAYS LAST):** Use `add-comments` to add a `[queued-for-journal: YYYY-MM-DD]` comment to the task. Do NOT complete these tasks — the journaling skill handles completion after the rant is journaled. Additionally, add each rant as an Open Thread in `Open Threads and Goals.md` (approval gate applies) with status "Queued for journal" so it's tracked even if journaling doesn't happen immediately.

**Deferred items** (presented but not approved): Use `add-comments` to add a `[presented: YYYY-MM-DD]` comment.

**All resolved items** (except rants and deferred): Use `complete-tasks` to close.

### Per-Item Error Handling

If execution fails for one item:
- Report the error for that specific item
- Continue processing remaining items
- Failed items are left incomplete for the next run

---

## Phase 7 — Rant Handoff (Cross-Skill)

Rants queued in Phase 6 are picked up by the `journaling-assistant` skill:

1. At session start, the journaling skill checks Claude's Inbox for tasks with `[queued-for-journal: YYYY-MM-DD]` comments.
2. Queued rants are presented as available topics alongside the journaling skill's normal thread surfacing.
3. After a rant is journaled, the journaling skill completes the original inbox task via `complete-tasks`.
4. If rants accumulate across multiple days without a journaling session, they remain queued — each subsequent inbox run skips them (the re-presentation guard recognizes the `[queued-for-journal]` marker) until a journaling session processes them.

---

## Tone

Direct and brief. No affirmations. Status report style:

"Found 5 notes in your inbox. Applied 1 meta-feedback change. 3 items ready for your review:"

---

## Error Handling

Error handling is **per-item, not all-or-nothing.**

- If one item fails during Phase 6 execution, report the error and continue with remaining items.
- Items already acted on are completed (their Todoist tasks closed).
- The failed item is reported with the specific error.
- Remaining items continue processing.
- Meta-feedback applied in Phase 3 is not rolled back — those changes are already written to files and are durable.
